# Meal-Dealio
### The Purpose
Keep track of your meal deal consumption. View your total, current streak, longest streak and total cash spent on meal deals. Earn achievements. 

### The Idea
My friend and I came up with the idea when I noticed he had eaten a meal every day for 5 days and I remarked that he was on an impressive meal deal streak. 

### The method
An Expo React-Native app that uses both UseState() and Classes. 
The data is backed up to Firestore database (This is my first time using it)
Tested the app using Jest
